### Machine Learning Projects for summer 2018

These are the practice projects / problems for me to get familiar, and brush up 
Machine learning algorithm implementations, using python ML libraries.

#### Libraries used
- Pytorch
- Keras
- Tensorflow maybe??

#### Potential Toy Problems
- Convolutional Neural Netowrk
- Long Short Term Memory
- Reinforcement Learning of sort
- etc... to be added more..
