### Machine Learning Projects for summer 2018

These are the practice projects / problems for me to get familiar, and brush up 
Machine learning algorithm implementations, using python ML libraries.

#### Libraries used
- Pytorch - currently on pytorch
- Keras
- Tensorflow maybe??

#### Potential Toy Problems
- DONE: with youtube tutorial in /CNN; Convolutional Neural Netowrk on FashionMNIST dataset
- Long Short Term Memory
- Reinforcement Learning of sort
- etc... to be added more..

#### Currently working on...
- NLP tutorial

#### Done so far...
- CNN with fashionMNIST
