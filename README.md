### Machine Learning Projects for summer 2018

These are the practice projects / problems for me to get familiar, and brush up 
Machine learning algorithm implementations, using python ML libraries.

#### Libraries used
- Pytorch - currently on pytorch
- Keras

#### Potential Toy Problems
- youtube tutorial in /CNN; Convolutional Neural Netowrk on FashionMNIST dataset
- Long Short Term Memory

#### Research Paper Referred
- [Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6806)
- [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)
- [Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167)
